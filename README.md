***
> On **December 2, 2015**, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist attack at the Inland Regional Center in **San Bernardino, California**, which consisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing. The perpetrators, **Syed Rizwan Farook** and **Tashfeen Malik**, a married couple living in the city of Redlands, targeted a **San Bernardino County Department of Public Health** training event and holiday party, of about 80 employees, in a rented banquet room. Farook was an American-born U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent, who worked as a health department employee. Malik was a Pakistani-born lawful permanent resident of the United States.

> After the shooting, the couple fled in a rented sport utility vehicle (SUV). Four hours later, police pursued their vehicle and killed them in a shootout. On **December 3**, the **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)** opened a **counter-terrorism investigation**. On December 6, in a prime-time address delivered from the Oval Office, President Barack Obama defined the shooting as an act of terrorism. -- [**2015 San Bernardino attack**, *Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack)

*The purpose of this repository is not to comment on the attack which took place on December 2nd but to investigate the resulting Apple vs. FBI case which which publicly began on February 16th, 2016. The focus will be on the technical details involving iOS security and the capabilities of the custom "FBiOS," as well as explore the legal ground for the case and the potential precedent for policies towards telecommunications providers using encryption. Court documents, official statements, and any important technical papers dealing with iOS security or functionality are also mirrored in this repository.*

*This is an experiment in open-source, decentralized citizen journalism using [Git software](https://git-scm.com/) & [the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs). All information is pulled from, and compared against, multiple sources. Information which is unsourced should not be taken as fact but as conjecture or opinion from the writer(s), though evidence to support it may be found later & will be included as soon as possible. Please notify the writer(s) if you notice inaccuracies. Statements from government officials or corporate executives in particular should always be evaluated critically, with the consideration that they are parties in a legal case which carries serious implications not only to themselves but to the public who (for the most part) is the intended audience, whether as citizen subjects or as customers.*
